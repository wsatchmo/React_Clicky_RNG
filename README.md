# React_Clicky (v2.0 - RNG Remiks)

```diff
+ How it works +
```

  - Defeat all 16 fighters, and hope the RNG gods are on your side. Fights range from easy to hard, with a 1/16 chance to roll a random loss on the first fight--to a 50/50 chance on the last round. Can you defeat every challenger?
  
  - Depending on the game's current state, the message will read one of four variants:

     * Not playing yet: "Defeat all challengers!"

     * Round won: "Another enemy defeated..."

     * Round lost: "Never stood a chance."

     * Total victory: "A new champion! HADOUKEN!"

  - These messages update dynamically based on the state of the game. Character cards also update dynamically after each victory.
